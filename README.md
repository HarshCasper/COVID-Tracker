  ## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
  
  This is a React Application which consumes a [COVID-19 Data API](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api) to provide real-time statistics and data insight about the COVID-19 Pandemic that is currently wreaking a havoc around the world. The primary purpose of the project was to create a statistical visualization for the data obtained from this API and allow the user to get real-time updates about the Pandemic situation.
